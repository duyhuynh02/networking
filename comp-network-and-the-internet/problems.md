# PROBLEMS
I decide to work on problems which I found interesting and challenging due to time limit. The full set of problems you can find and check on the textbook. Please buy a digital/hardcover to support the teachers. This solution is for educational purpose only.

## SOLUTIONS 
P2. Equation 1.1 gives a formula for the end-to-end delay of sending one packet
of length L over N links of transmission rate R. Generalize this formula for
sending P such packets back-to-back over the N links
```sh
Equation 1.1: d(end-to-end) = N * L / R
=> Total time to send P packets: P * N * L / R 
```

P3. Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a relatively long period of time. Answer the following questions, briefly justifying your answer:
a. Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched network be more appropriate for this application? Why?
```sh
Packet-switched network: efficient use of bandwidth, flexible, scalable, lower cost 
Circuit-switched network: guranteed bandwidth, low latency, predictable performance, suitable for real-time communication

Based on two characterisitcs, we can see that with N-bit unit of data every k time units, packet-switchied network would be more suitable. 
```

b. Suppose that a packet-switched network is used and the only traffic in this network comes from such applications as described above. Furthermore, assume that the sum of the application data rates is less than the capacities of each and every link. Is some form of congestion control needed? Why?
```sh
Based on the definition, congestion control is the technique which can prevent the congestion. Congestion can cause a network response time slows down, and the delay increases, leading to retranmissions and worsening the situation. 

It will base on how much it's lesser. If it's lesser just a little bit (or equal just like we see the animation in the course), we still need some forms of congestion control. 

(Hints from google: yes, cause it's essential for network stability, fairness, and predictable performance).

P5. Review the car-caravan analogy in Section 1.4. Assume a propagation speed of 100 km/hour.
a. Suppose the caravan travels 175 km, beginning in front of one tollbooth, passing through a second tollbooth, and finishing just after a third tollbooth. What is the end-to-end delay?
```sh
Processing delay: d(proc)
Queing delay: d(queue)
Tranmission delay: d(trans) = L/R
Propagation delay: d(prop) = d/s (assume s is 2.10^8 m/s)

d(nodal) = d(proc) + d(queue) + d(trans) + d(prop)
         =           2 minutes (120s) + (175 / (2.10^8))
```
b. Repeat (a), now assuming that there are eight cars in the caravan instead of ten.
```sh
Same formula, but instead of 120s, this time is 12 x 8 = 96s + (175 / 2.10^8)
```

P7. In this problem, we consider sending real-time voice from Host A to Host B over a packet-switched network (VoIP). Host A converts analog voice to a digital 64 kbps bit stream on the fly. Host A then groups the bits into 56-byte packets. There is one link between Hosts A and B; its transmission rate is 10 Mbps and its propagation delay is 10 msec. As soon as Host A gathers a packet, it sends it to Host B. As soon as Host B receives an entire packet, it converts the packetâ€™s bits to an analog signal. How much time elapses from the time a bit is created (from the original analog signal at Host A) until the bit is decoded (as part of the analog signal at Host B)?
```sh
Transmission rate is 10 Mbps -> time delay is: packet size in bits / tranmission rate = 64 * 10 ^ 3 / 10 * 10^6 = 0.0064 ms
Propagation delay is 10 ms
Total time d(nodal) = d(trans) + d(prop) = 0.0064 + 10 = 10.0064
```

P8. Suppose users share a 10 Mbps link. Also suppose each user requires 200 kbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 10 percent of the time. (See the discussion of packet switching versus circuit switching in Section 1.3.)
a. When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported?
```sh
50 
```

b. For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet switching is used. Find the probability that a given user is transmitting.
```sh
Use binomial distribution, form the wikipedia, we can get:
F(n,k) = (n choose k) * (p^k) * (1 - p)^(n-k) 
```

c. Suppose there are 120 users. Find the probability that at any given time,
exactly n users are transmitting simultaneously. (Hint: Use the binomial
distribution.)
```sh
Each user transmit only 10 percent of the time -> so p = 0.1 and q = 0.9. 
F(120, 50) = (120 choose 50) * (0.1 ^ 50) * (0.9 ^ 70).
```

d. Find the probability that there are 51 or more users transmitting
simultaneously.
```sh
F(120, 51) = (120 choose 51) * (0.1 ^ 51) * (0.9 ^ 69).
```

P10. Consider the network illustrated in Figure 1.16. Assume the two hosts on the left of the figure start transmitting packets of 1500 bytes at the same time towards Router B. Suppose the link rates between the hosts and Router A is 4-Mbps. One link has a 6-ms propagation delay and the other has a 2-ms propagation delay. Will queuing delay occur at Router A?
```sh
R = 4 Mbps -> tranmission delay will be = (1500 bytes * 8) / (4 * 1024) = 12000 / 4 * 10^6 = 3ms 
First one: 6-ms propagation delay -> packet reaches route A at t = tramission delay + propagation delay = 3ms + 6ms = 9ms 
2nd one: 2-ms propagation delay -> packet reaches route A at t = 3m + 2ms = 5ms 

So, the answer is NO. 
```

P14. Consider the queuing delay in a router buffer. Let I denote traffic intensity; that is, I = La/R. Suppose that the queuing delay takes the form IL/R (1 - I) for I 6 1.
a. Provide a formula for the total delay, that is, the queuing delay plus the transmission delay.
b. Plot the total delay as a function of L/R
```sh
